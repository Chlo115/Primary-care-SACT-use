	abstract = {Objective This study investigated the awareness of non-oncology specialist medical staff about commonly used oral anticancer medicines (OAMs).
Methods Interviews conducted with a range of nononcology specialist doctors.
Results The recognition of OAMs was poor by all grades of doctors, with capecitabine being the only drug recognised by more than half the doctors (26 of 40; 65\%). Consultant medical staff scored signiﬁcantly better than most junior grades of staff.
Conclusions A barrier to safe patient care appears to be the initial identiﬁcation of OAMs on acute admission. Once a drug had been identiﬁed as an OAM, doctors are aware that they should not prescribe it and should contact the acute oncology service for advice. A range of measures has been introduced to improve the identiﬁcation of OAMs by doctors.},

	abstract = {Prescribing of cytotoxic drugs, immunosuppressant agents and drugs with a narrow 
therapeutic index by inadequately trained doctors is a longstanding problem. Current systems 
lack appropriate safeguards and an ongoing and predictable risk to patient safety remains1
. 
Recommendations for actions required to address these safety concerns include: 
1. Mandating the use of e-prescribing for these agents with prescribing rights restricted 
to appropriately trained practitioners 
2. A single standard prescription chart should be used across the 4 nations until 
e-prescribing is universally available
3. Prominent warnings regarding these agents should appear in reference sources (such 
as the British National Formulary) and they should be highlighted in local and national 
formularies
4. Packaging and labeling should be standardised with dosage, dose schedule and 
appropriate warnings clearly visible. Warnings should be highlighted within patient 
information
5. Intravenous administration of cytotoxics should only be performed by appropriately 
trained staff.
Education and Training
6. Definitions of levels of training and competency, specific for the safe prescribing 
of cytotoxic and immunosuppressive agents, should be incorporated into all 
undergraduate and postgraduate training curricula 
7. A training and assessment package relating to the prescribing and administering of 
cytotoxic and immunosuppressive agents should be developed, commissioned and 
made available on the Electronic Learning for Healthcare platform. 
Organisation and Governance
Local education providers (LEPs) should ensure 
8. Induction sessions include mandatory training and briefing on agents with a narrow 
therapeutic index likely to be encountered during a placement. 
9. Compliance with any restrictions and training requirements in prescribing, mandated by 
training curricula and/or the LETB or Deanery
Chief Medical Officers along with National Agencies and Royal Colleges should act upon these 
recommendations in the interests of patient safety and institute and deliver appropriate standards 
and safeguards, applicable across specialties and across the four nations. 
The impact of these changes should be the target of local quality improvement projects2
assessed by local audit and repeating the national survey of practice carried out by local audit 
and periodic national surveys of practice},
